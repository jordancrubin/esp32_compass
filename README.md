ESP32_Compass - A Programme to demonstrate functionality of HMC5883 triple
  axis magnetic sensor in conjunction with an LCD display.  Graphical code 
  adaptation from Volos Projects https://www.youtube.com/@VolosProjects
  for rotating display. Great work with TFT-ESPI.

  This project can be found at [channel here].  

  Im using my 240x240 display though a TTgo t-display would also work well.  Its
  import and to set the alignment to the display such that it is in phase to be flipped 
  by the tft_espi library.

  This project has been built on the ESP32 Development board https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdsyLkxvaPY
